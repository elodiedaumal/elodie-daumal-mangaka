## About of this application

The Rick and Morty Characters App is a React front end application that makes requests to the Rick and Morty API from the users web browser.

In this project I've used REACT and the Rick and Morty API, to create an application with a search bar that filters and displays the character info that the user type in. I selected Netlify as a deployment method.

### Frontend of this application:

The frontend app has been built with React.js. I used React Query and installed the npm package Axios library to make CRUD HTTP requests to Rest API. To fetch JSON data from the API I used the useQuery hook, and in order to create and delete data I used the useMutation hook.
